## (Current Release) Archivematica 1.16.0 and Storage Service 0.22.0

*Release date*: May 16, 2024

[Original release
notes](https://wiki.archivematica.org/Archivematica_1.16.0_and_Storage_Service_0.22.0_release_notes).

### Environments

Please see the [installation
instructions](https://www.archivematica.org/en/docs/archivematica-1.16/admin-manual/installation-setup/installation/installation/#installation).

Archivematica 1.16.0 and Storage Service 0.22.0 have been tested in the
following environments:

- Ubuntu 22.04 64-bit Server Edition
- Rocky Linux 9 x86\_64

For development purposes, most of our developers prefer to use Docker
containers. These and all above environments are linked from the
installation instructions above.

### Added

#### List jobs API endpoint returns detailed output {#list_jobs_api_endpoint_returns_detailed_output}

- Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/1641>

A `detailed` parameter was added to the [List
jobs](https://www.archivematica.org/en/docs/archivematica-1.16/dev-manual/api/api-reference-archivematica/#list-jobs)
API endpoint. When the parameter is sent in the request, the endpoint
will return all the task properties returned by the
[Task](https://www.archivematica.org/en/docs/archivematica-1.16/dev-manual/api/api-reference-archivematica/#task)
endpoint.

### Changed

#### PRONOM v.116 {#pronom_v.116}

As of this Archivematica release, we are up to date to PRONOM v. 116.

[GitHub issue 1653](https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/1653)

#### Python versions {#python_versions}

- Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/1632>

Archivematica 1.16 works with all the current [Python supported
versions](https://devguide.python.org/versions/#supported-versions): 3.8
to 3.12.

#### Django 4.2 {#django_4.2}

- Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/1624>

Archivematica 1.16 dropped support for Django 3.2.

### Fixed

#### Update MCPClient forking model {#update_mcpclient_forking_model}

- Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/1482>

Archivematica 1.16.0 introduces a new prefork execution model in
MCPClient based on a process pool. MCPClient workers are automatically
restarted to free resources and will reuse database connections when
possible.

The following new settings were added to the MCPClient service:

- `ARCHIVEMATICA_MCPCLIENT_WORKERS` defines the number of MCPClient
    workers. If undefined, it defaults to the number of CPUs available
    on the machine. Only client modules that define
    `concurrent_instances` will perform concurrent execution of tasks
    (e.g. identify\_file\_format).
- `ARCHIVEMATICA_MCPCLIENT_MAX_TASKS_PER_CHILD` defines the maximum
    number of tasks a worker can execute before it\'s replaced by a new
    process in order to free resources.
- `ARCHIVEMATICA_MCPCLIENT_MCPCLIENT_PROMETHEUS_DETAILED_METRICS`
    indicates that detailed metrics should be sent to Prometheus. With
    large transfers this might affect performance of the local storage
    in Prometheus and slow down its threads in Archivematica.

See the [MCPClient
Configuration](https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica/blob/48004c5bd798ccb54196720103b462654bf9b08d/src/MCPClient/install/README.md)

### Fixed {#fixed_1}

#### API endpoint for listing unapproved transfers returns error {#api_endpoint_for_listing_unapproved_transfers_returns_error}

- Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/1635>

UUID identifiers were not encoded properly in the **List Unapproved
Transfers** and **List SIPS Waiting for User Input** API endpoints.

#### Transfers cannot be moved to the rejected directory {#transfers_cannot_be_moved_to_the_rejected_directory}

- Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/1636>

In the Archivematica 1.15.0 update, there was a backward-incompatible
change involving the configuration parsers for Django settings. This
change, part of a simplification process, has affected the handling of
the *%%sharedPath%%* variable. This variable is no longer included in
the default settings. If your custom settings rely on this variable, you
should now use *%sharedPath%* to maintain compatibility with the updated
system.

Please see the 1.15.1 milestone in GitHub for all issues addressed in
this release:
<https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/milestone/25?closed=1>.

## Storage Service 0.19 release notes

[Original release
notes](https://wiki.archivematica.org/Storage_Service_0.19_Release_Notes)

- *Release date*: 25 Feb 2022

This release adds a new feature to the Storage Service

### Environments {#environments_5}

Please see the [installation
instructions](https://www.archivematica.org/en/docs/latest/admin-manual/installation-setup/installation/installation/#installation).

Storage Service 0.19.0 has been tested in the following environments:

- Ubuntu 18.04 64-bit Server Edition
- CentOS 7 64-bit

Please note that we\'ve dropped support for Ubuntu Linux 16.04 since it
reached the end of its five-year LTS window on April 30th 2021. We\'re
planning to add support for Ubuntu 20.04 in the near future.

For development purposes, most of our developers prefer to use Docker
containers. These and all above environments are linked from the
installation instructions above.

### Upgrading

- With the new permission module (see [pull request
    \#625](https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica-storage-service/pull/625)
    for more), existing users defined in the application database will
    automatically become administrators when the Django migrations are
    executed. If your Storage Service is configured with an external
    authentication backend, you can use
    [SS\_AUTH\_DEFAULT\_USER\_ROLE](https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica-storage-service/tree/stable/0.19.x/install)
    to establish a new default user role for authenticated users or
    tweak the [authentication backend
    settings](https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica-storage-service/blob/stable/0.19.x/storage_service/storage_service/settings/base.py)
    to map the user roles according to your needs.

### Added {#added_2}

#### User roles {#user_roles}

- Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/1486>

The Storage Service now includes four different user roles:
administrators, managers, reviewers and readers. Previously, users were
either administrators or not administrators, the only difference being
that administrators can create, edit, and delete other users. All
existing users will automatically become administrators on upgrade. You
may wish to review your users and adjust their permissions as needed.

Supported authentication backends like LDAP, Shibboleth or CAS include
new configuration attributes to promote authenticated users.

See
[Users](https://www.archivematica.org/en/docs/storage-service-0.19/administrators/#users)
in the Storage Service documentation for more information.

### Fixed {#fixed_5}

- Storage Service 0.18.x doesn\'t follow symlinks:
    <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/1515>

## Archivematica 1.13.2

[Original release
notes](notes:https://wiki.archivematica.org/Archivematica_1.13.2).

*Release date*: 13 Dec 2021

This release fixes a critical security issue found in the Archivematica
dashboard that allows unauthorized users to access some parts of the
Administration tab.

This issue was discovered as a result of a security audit by Scholars
Portal. It was not discovered as a result of a breach. Scholars Portal
reported the issue to Artefactual privately via email. Once we became
aware of the issue, we began to develop the fix. Artefactual has also
implemented security reporting process documentation across
Archivematica-related GitHub repositories and changed issue templates to
reflect a more secure process. You can review Archivematica's security
reporting process here:
<https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica/security/policy>.

### Upgrading {#upgrading_1}

The fix can be easily installed since this issue only affects the
dashboard.

CentOS users relying on Archivematica packages should run:

    sudo yum -y update archivematica-dashboard
    sudo systemctl restart archivematica-dashboard

Automated installations using Ansible should deploy from the stable
branch: stable/1.13.x.

Alternately, a fix can be applied to the web server. The following
configuration snippet shows an updated Nginx server block with the
additional rule added.

    server {
       listen 80;
       client_max_body_size 256M;
       server_name _;
       location / {
           set $upstream_endpoint http://archivematica-dashboard:8000;
           proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
           proxy_redirect off;
           proxy_buffering off;
           proxy_read_timeout 172800s;
           proxy_pass $upstream_endpoint;
       }

       # Directive to block access to admin pages in
       # Archivematica v1.11.0 or older.
       location ~ ^/administration/accounts/login/.+$ {
           return 404;
       }
    }

After the fix has been applied, please be sure to update passwords and
API keys:

- Change the password and API key for the Storage Service user:
    -- In the Storage Service, change the password for the Storage
      Service user that the Archivematica dashboard uses. This will
      also regenerate the API key for the Storage Service user.
    -- In the Archivematica dashboard, under Administration \> General,
      update the Storage Service user password and the API key to
      reflect the new password/key.
- Change the password for AtoM/Binder DIP upload.
- Review the PREMIS agent information to ensure that it is correct.

### Added {#added_3}

#### Disableable virus scanning {#disableable_virus_scanning}

- Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/869>

Virus scanning can now be disabled from the processing configuration.

This change was **contributed** by Bodleian Library. Thank you!

#### Purge management command {#purge_management_command}

- Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/1239>

A new [management
command](https://www.archivematica.org/en/docs/archivematica-1.13/admin-manual/maintenance/maintenance/#management-commands)
has been added to provide a mechanism to remove old processing data from
the system filling up the application database and search indices.

#### Strong password validation {#strong_password_validation}

- Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/1332>

Archivematica and the Storage Service can now require strong passwords
for user accounts. Prompts are given when creating a new user if the
password doesn\'t meet the requirements.

This feature was **sponsored** by the City of Winnipeg Archives. Thank
you!

#### Audit logging capability {#audit_logging_capability}

- Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/1341>

This addition allows audit logs to be written to third party
applications- Artefactual Systems\' implementation of this is in a new
application called
[Auditmatica](https://github.com/artefactual-labs/auditmatica). The
change in Archivematica and the Storage Service is only to facilitate
the capture of audit logging information in other applications.

This addition was **sponsored** by the City of Winnipeg Archives. Thank
you!

#### Customized workflow file {#customized_workflow_file}

- Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/1441>

This feature allows the user to indicate the location/existence of a
customized workflow document, in json. This would allow institutions to
add to the Archivematica workflow (e.g. custom micro-services) in a way
that is easier to maintain through upgrades. Developer documentation is
pending.

### Changed {#changed_4}

#### Python 3 {#python_3}

- Issues:
    <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A1.13.0+label%3A%22%3Asnake%3A%C2%B3+Python+3%22>

All Archivematica components are now running on Python 3.6.

#### Archivematica Storage Service now uses MySQL by default {#archivematica_storage_service_now_uses_mysql_by_default}

- Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/952>

MySQL is now the default database in Archivematica Storage Service.
SQLite is still supported but we encourage users to migrate. We have
documented the process: [Migrating data from SQLite to
MySQL](https://www.archivematica.org/en/docs/storage-service-0.18/migration-sqlite-mysql/#migration-sqlite-mysql).

#### Allow replicated AIPs to be packaged in a different format {#allow_replicated_aips_to_be_packaged_in_a_different_format}

- Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/1440>

By using an offline replica storage space it is now possible to
replicate AIPs in a different packaging format than the original AIP
(helpful in use cases such as offline tape storage, etc).

This change was **sponsored** by Norwegian Health Archives. Thank you!

#### Tasks will open in one tab only {#tasks_will_open_in_one_tab_only}

- Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/85>

Now instead of opening multiple tabs every time a user clicks on a task
gear, they will all open in one new tab.

This change was **contributed** by Bodleian Library. Thank you!

#### Dev tools deprecated / Hiding active packages {#dev_tools_deprecated_hiding_active_packages}

Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/68>

Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/1446>

Due to maintainability issues, we have removed the devtools repo. The
most commonly used dev tool was used for resolving hidden transfers,
which should no longer be relevant since resolving [Issue
1446](https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/1446)- active
transfers or SIPs can no longer be hidden. However as a precaution, we
have made that command available within Archivematica
(<https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica/blob/qa/1.x/src/dashboard/src/main/management/commands/resolve_pending_jobs.py>).

#### DIP storage locations now allowed in S3 spaces {#dip_storage_locations_now_allowed_in_s3_spaces}

### Fixed {#fixed_7}

Please see the 1.13 milestone in GitHub for all issues addressed in this
release: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/milestone/17>.

Archivematica 1.12.2

[Original release
notes](https://wiki.archivematica.org/Archivematica_1.12.2).

*Release date*: 13 Dic 2021

This release fixes a critical security issue found in the Archivematica
dashboard that allows unauthorized users to access some parts of the
Administration tab.

This issue was discovered as a result of a security audit by Scholars
Portal. It was not discovered as a result of a breach. Scholars Portal
reported the issue to Artefactual privately via email. Once we became
aware of the issue, we began to develop the fix. Artefactual has also
implemented security reporting process documentation across
Archivematica-related GitHub repositories and changed issue templates to
reflect a more secure process. You can review Archivematica's security
reporting process here:
<https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica/security/policy>.

### Upgrading {#upgrading_2}

The fix can be easily installed since this issue only affects the
dashboard.

CentOS users relying on Archivematica packages should run:

    sudo yum -y update archivematica-dashboard
    sudo systemctl restart archivematica-dashboard

Automated installations using Ansible should deploy from the stable
branch: stable/1.12.x.

Alternately, a fix can be applied to the web server. The following
configuration snippet shows an updated Nginx server block with the
additional rule added.

    server {
       listen 80;
       client_max_body_size 256M;
       server_name _;
       location / {
           set $upstream_endpoint http://archivematica-dashboard:8000;
           proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
           proxy_redirect off;
           proxy_buffering off;
           proxy_read_timeout 172800s;
           proxy_pass $upstream_endpoint;
       }

       # Directive to block access to admin pages in
       # Archivematica v1.11.0 or older.
       location ~ ^/administration/accounts/login/.+$ {
           return 404;
       }
    }

After the fix has been applied, please be sure to update passwords and
API keys:

- Change the password and API key for the Storage Service user:
    -- In the Storage Service, change the password for the Storage
       Service user that the Archivematica dashboard uses. This will
       also regenerate the API key for the Storage Service user.
    -- In the Archivematica dashboard, under Administration \> General,
       update the Storage Service user password and the API key to
       reflect the new password/key.
- Change the password for AtoM/Binder DIP upload.
- Review the PREMIS agent information to ensure that it is correct.

### Changed {#changed_5}

#### Django 1.12 support {#django_1.12_support}

- Issue: <https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica/issues/1016>

Archivematica has been upgraded to Django 1.12 LTS. Our next target is
Django 2.2 LTS!

There are a couple of things to be aware of during the Archivematica
upgrade in this respect:

- For a seamless experience for your users make sure that all active
    user sessions are deleted. We explain how here: [Maintenance \>
    Clear user
    sessions](https://www.archivematica.org/en/docs/archivematica-1.12/admin-manual/maintenance/maintenance/#clear-user-sessions).
- Django\'s User model now comes with a character limit of 150
    characters. In Archivematica v1.11.x or older we had that limit set
    to 250 characters via a third-party app that we have now deleted.
    During the database migration (i.e. when running manage.py migrate),
    users may be required to fix the problem manually. See the
    [migration module
    documentation](https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica/blob/f87d2f39acce9a59bf49f72fd7e57f9eced2dbe5/src/dashboard/src/main/migrations/0078_username_check.py#L1-L20)
    for more details. We expect this to be highly unlikely to happen
    since the exception is only triggered when the 150 character limit
    in the username field is exceeded.

#### Replace whitelist with allowlist {#replace_whitelist_with_allowlist}

- Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/1226>

We have changed \"whitelist\" to \"allowlist\" in an effort to use more
inclusive language throughout Archivematica\'s code.

### Fixed {#fixed_9}

- Status doesn\'t revert to \"Stored\" after deletion requests are
    rejected: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/1273>
- Cannot create a SIP from a Bag transfer in Appraisal tab:
    <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/1267>
- Transfer/AIP status not in sync when package is deleted within SS:
    <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/1189>
- Cannot rebuild backlog or AIP indices when location is encrypted:
    <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/734>
- Disk usage pages are not reporting accurate numbers:
    <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/1281>

And more! Please see the 1.12 milestone in Github for all issues
addressed in this release:

### Added {#added_5}

#### PREMIS Event import {#premis_event_import}

This feature allows the import of PREMIS events which took place prior
to processing in Archivematica. The PREMIS events are written in an xml
format (see [sample
data](https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica-sampledata/blob/master/SampleTransfers/PremisImporter/metadata/premis.xml))
and placed in the metadata folder of a transfer. The PREMIS events are
then written to the AIP METS file.

This work was sponsored by Piql and the Norwegian Health Archives. Thank
you!

- [Documentation](https://www.archivematica.org/en/docs/archivematica-1.11/user-manual/transfer/import-metadata/#premis-xml)
- Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/710>

#### S3 as a transfer source {#s3_as_a_transfer_source}

This allows an Amazon S3 space to be used as a transfer source location.
This feature is a community PR from Wellcome Collection. Thank you!

- [Documentation](https://www.archivematica.org/en/docs/storage-service-0.16/administrators/#s3-amazon)
- Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/975>

#### Easier access to AIP METS {#easier_access_to_aip_mets}

This feature add a \"View METS\" button in the user interface when
viewing an AIP in Archival Storage. The METS file is then downloaded to
your desktop for your viewing pleasure.

- Documentation: pending
- Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/644>

#### Zipped transfers {#zipped_transfers}

This is a new transfer type that enables a zipped (non-bagged) package
to be a transfer. Similar to the zipped bag transfer, the name of the
package is used as the transfer name. This is a community contribution
by Wellcome Collection. Thank you!

- [Documentation](https://www.archivematica.org/en/docs/archivematica-1.11/user-manual/transfer/transfer/#transfer-types)
- Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/682>

#### Add package name as configurable value to call backs {#add_package_name_as_configurable_value_to_call_backs}

When using AIP, AIC, and DIP store callbacks, the package\_name is now a
configurable value. This is a community contribution from Concordia
University Libraries, who developed this to facilitate an EPrints to
Archivematica workflow. Thank you!

- Documentation: pending
- Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/978>

### Changed {#changed_6}

#### Performance and monitoring improvements {#performance_and_monitoring_improvements}

This is a collection of issues fixed that improve performance for
processing at scale, and also enable performance monitoring through
external applications such as Prometheus and Grafana.

These updates have been sponsored by Piql and the Norwegian Health
Archives. Thank you!

- [Documentation](https://www.archivematica.org/en/docs/archivematica-1.11/admin-manual/installation-setup/customization/instrumentation/)
- Issues:
    -- Commonly used database tables don\'t have indexes:
       <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/907>
    -- MCPServer should reuse database connections:
       <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/913>
    -- Archivematica does not output metrics to analyze its
       performance:
       <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/906>
    -- MCPService must process all transfer packages sent to it at
       once: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/911>
    -- Some jobs run even when disabled:
       <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/866>

    -- index\_aip crashes elasticsearch for large transfers:
       <https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica/issues/1199>

#### Improvements for full disks {#improvements_for_full_disks}

Managing workflows when various spaces on the disk fill up is a
recognized pain point for Archivematica users. This project makes three
overall changes to storage space reporting in Archivematica and the
Storage Service in an effort to mitigate these issues:

- Change the processing storage usage page to clarify storage
    paths/locations and improve usability
- Improve the transfer source location and AIP storage location pages
    to clarify storage paths/locations and improve usability
- Change Storage Service functionality to support the above changes.
- Documentation: pending
- [Issues](https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues?q=label%3A%22RED+TEAM%3A+disk+full+project%22+is%3Aclosed)

#### Changes to default normalization for videos/images {#changes_to_default_normalization_for_videosimages}

Archivematica\'s default FPR normalization rules were creating in some
cases very large video files for arguably no sound preservation reason.
After discussion and community consultation, we have removed default
video normalization rules. Users can still \"opt in\" to the rules but
they are not enabled by default in **new or upgraded** installations.
Any custom changes you have made to your own FPR will still be
maintained after upgrade. We also removed default rules for preservation
for PNG, JPG, GIF and DNG still images. For full details and affected
formats, see [this
comment](https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/912#issuecomment-565197594)
in the issue ticket.

- Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/912>

#### Allow users to choose whether to receive fail report emails {#allow_users_to_choose_whether_to_receive_fail_report_emails}

Users can now be configured to either receive fail report emails or not
(previously all users received the emails). This is a community
contribution from Hillel Arnold at Rockefeller Archive Center- thank
you!

- Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/709>

#### Change name of sanitize names micro-service {#change_name_of_sanitize_names_micro_service}

Following reading a paper by [Elvia
Arroyo-Ramirez](https://medium.com/on-archivy/invisible-defaults-and-perceived-limitations-processing-the-juan-gelman-files-4187fdd36759)
we decided to change the name of this micro-service and align it more
with the Library of Congress events vocabulary. The micro-service now
displays as \"Change transfer filenames\" and \"Change SIP filenames\"
in the Transfer and Ingest tabs respectively.

- Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/230>

#### Drop-down menu orders {#drop_down_menu_orders}

In short, the order of options in drop down menus were all over the
place and it was driving us nuts so we finally tried to put them in more
logical orders.

- Issue: <https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica/issues/891>

### Removed

#### Quarantine

As [discussed on the community
forum](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/archivematica/rGMsO8htF38/Pl-eLimwAgAJ)
the quarantine micro-service has been removed from Archivematica in this
release.

## Archivematica 1.10.2

[Original release
notes](https://wiki.archivematica.org/Archivematica_1.10.2).

*Release date*: 20 May 2020

This release fixes a critical security issue found in the Archivematica
dashboard that allows unauthorized users to access some parts of the
Administration tab.

This issue was discovered as a result of a security audit by Scholars
Portal. It was not discovered as a result of a breach. Scholars Portal
reported the issue to Artefactual privately via email. Once we became
aware of the issue, we began to develop the fix. Artefactual has also
implemented security reporting process documentation across
Archivematica-related GitHub repositories and changed issue templates to
reflect a more secure process. You can review Archivematica's security
reporting process here:
<https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica/security/policy>.

### Upgrading {#upgrading_4}

The fix can be easily installed since this issue only affects the
dashboard.

CentOS users relying on Archivematica packages should run:

    sudo yum -y update archivematica-dashboard
    sudo systemctl restart archivematica-dashboard

Automated installations using Ansible should deploy from our stable
branches: stable/1.9.x, stable/1.10.x or stable/1.11.x.

Alternately, a fix can be applied to the web server. The following
configuration snippet shows an updated Nginx server block with the
additional rule added.

    server {
       listen 80;
       client_max_body_size 256M;
       server_name _;
       location / {
           set $upstream_endpoint http://archivematica-dashboard:8000;
           proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
           proxy_redirect off;
           proxy_buffering off;
           proxy_read_timeout 172800s;
           proxy_pass $upstream_endpoint;
       }

       # Directive to block access to admin pages in
       # Archivematica v1.11.0 or older.
       location ~ ^/administration/accounts/login/.+$ {
           return 404;
       }
    }

After the fix has been applied, please be sure to update passwords and
API keys:

- Change the password and API key for the Storage Service user:
    -- In the Storage Service, change the password for the Storage
       Service user that the Archivematica dashboard uses. This will
       also regenerate the API key for the Storage Service user.
    -- In the Archivematica dashboard, under Administration \> General,
       update the Storage Service user password and the API key to
       reflect the new password/key.
- Change the password for AtoM/Binder DIP upload.
- Review the PREMIS agent information to ensure that it is correct.

## Archivematica 1.10 and Storage Service 0.15

[Original release
notes](https://wiki.archivematica.org/Archivematica_1.10_and_Storage_Service_0.15_release_notes).

**Release date** September 5, 2019

### Supported environments {#supported_environments_1}

Please see the [installation
instructions](https://www.archivematica.org/en/docs/archivematica-1.10/admin-manual/installation-setup/installation/installation/#installation).

Archivematica 1.10 and Storage Service 0.15 are supported for production
use in the following environments:

- Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit Server Edition
- Ubuntu 18.04 64-bit Server Edition
- CentOS 7 64-bit

For development purposes, most of our developers prefer to use Docker
containers. These and all above supported environments are linked from
the installation instructions above.

### Added {#added_6}

#### Information Packaging (Backlog) Workflow Enhancements {#information_packaging_backlog_workflow_enhancements}

Simon Fraser University has sponsored a development project to improve
the ability to store Transfers for a long period of time. The goal is to
improve the metadata quality of Transfers to reduce the risk of storing
them for a long period of time in a backlog. As a result of this
project:

- Transfers placed in backlog are now packaged as bags
- The Transfer METS file now records all preservation actions that
    took place during Transfer.
- The Appraisal Tab now handles packages with more than 1,000 files.
- A backlog can be populated from a new pipeline from transfers
    created by another pipeline.
- Documentation:
    <https://www.archivematica.org/en/docs/archivematica-1.10/user-manual/appraisal/appraisal/#appraisal>
- Issues (linked from epic):
    <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/391>

#### \"Vintage\" AIP handling {#vintage_aip_handling}

AIPS created in Archivematica prior to version 1.0 can't currently be
re-ingested in more recent versions (due to namespace collisions with
the use of PREMIS 2.1).

This change will make it possible to reingest these older AIPS into
Archivematica. This work is sponsored by the City of Vancouver Archives.

- Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/24>

#### LDAP support for Storage Service {#ldap_support_for_storage_service}

The Archivematica Storage Service now supports LDAP integration. This
was sponsored by Piql for the Norwegian Health Archives.

- Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/680>

#### External PID declaration {#external_pid_declaration}

This feature, sponsored by the International Institute of Social
History, allows users to include identifiers minted outside of
Archivematica in their transfer and written to the premis:object
metadata in the AIP METS file. This is done via an identifiers.json file
included in the transfer.

- Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/133>
- Documentation:
    <https://www.archivematica.org/en/docs/archivematica-1.10/user-manual/transfer/transfer/#transfer-pids>

#### Avalon Integration {#avalon_integration}

Archivematica 1.10 has added the ability to integrate with [Avalon Media
System](https://www.avalonmediasystem.org/) through the automation
tools. This was sponsored by Northwestern University and Indiana
University through IMLS funding. The feature allows users to prepare and
store a DIP appropriate for upload the Avalon, and then have the
automation tools send it to Avalon for ingest into that system.

- Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/643>
- Documentation:
    <https://www.archivematica.org/en/docs/archivematica-1.10/admin-manual/installation-setup/integrations/integrations/#avalon-media-system-integration>

#### Include AIP UUID in bag-info.txt {#include_aip_uuid_in_bag_info.txt}

This change adds the UUID of the AIP to the External-Identifier field of
the bag-info.txt file. This change is a **community contribution** by
Helen Sherwood-Taylor (Wellcome Collection)- thank you!

- Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/492>
- Documentation:
    <https://www.archivematica.org/en/docs/archivematica-1.10/user-manual/archival-storage/aip-structure/#bagit-doc>

#### Allow designation of ArchivesSpace repository using DSpace REST location {#allow_designation_of_archivesspace_repository_using_dspace_rest_location}

This feature allows designation of more than one ArchivesSpace
repository by enabling it via the DSpace REST location rather than
through the configuration in the Storage Service. This was a **community
contribution** by Hrafn Malmquist (University of Edinburgh)- thank you!

- Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/435>
- Documentation:
    <https://www.archivematica.org/en/docs/storage-service-0.15/administrators/#dspace-via-rest-api>

### Changed {#changed_7}

#### AIP METS in PREMIS 3 {#aip_mets_in_premis_3}

As a result of the vintage AIP work described above, we have upgraded
the AIP METS file to use PREMIS 3 exclusively. In previous versions it
had a mix of versions 2 and 3.

- Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/370>

#### API endpoint for manifest validation (beta) {#api_endpoint_for_manifest_validation_beta}

As part of the Avalon integration described above, we added an endpoint
that can be called to validate a manifest. While this is currently only
implemented for the Avalon manifest, it could for example be extended in
the future for metadata.csv validation and similar.

- Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/618>
- Documentation:
    <https://wiki.archivematica.org/Archivematica_API#Validate>

#### Extended service callbacks {#extended_service_callbacks}

This change allows the creation of callbacks for AIP, AIC, and DIP
storage events. This was done in service to integration with SCOPE, a
DIP access platform in use by the Canadian Centre for Architecture, but
is widely applicable to other use cases.

- Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/147>

#### Storage Service packages tab tidy-up {#storage_service_packages_tab_tidy_up}

This change was the result of a reported bug for the Storage Service
packages tab timing out- we addressed that issue but also tidied up the
tab to make it more generally usable. See the issue for discussion of
changes.

- Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/676>
- Documentation:
    <https://www.archivematica.org/en/docs/storage-service-0.15/administrators/#packages-tab>

#### Code formatting to be handled by black {#code_formatting_to_be_handled_by_black}

The developer team has decided to use a code formatting tool (black) to
make formatting more consistent. Pull requests to Archivematica are now
checked with a linter to ensure consistency with black.

- Issue: <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/393>

#### Additions and improvements to the AMAUATs {#additions_and_improvements_to_the_amauats}

The AMAUATs are the Archivematica Automated User Acceptance Tests.
Thanks to **sponsorship by Wellcome Collection** we have greatly
expanded the number of automated tests that run and made most of them
\"black box\" tests that run via the API- this means they are more
robust than tests that rely on the user interface, which can break
anytime the user interface changes in some way. In addition to these
improvements, to aid in the release process we have made the AMAUATs
have versions that go along with the Archivematica version being
released. Please see the AMAUAT repo for more information:
<https://github.com/artefactual-labs/archivematica-acceptance-tests>

## Archivematica 1.9 and Storage Service 0.14 release notes

[Original release
notes](https://wiki.archivematica.org/Archivematica_1.9_and_Storage_Service_0.14_release_notes).

Release date: **March 6, 2019**

### Supported environments {#supported_environments_2}

Please see the [installation
instructions](https://www.archivematica.org/en/docs/archivematica-1.9/admin-manual/installation-setup/installation/installation/#installation).

Archivematica 1.9 and Storage Service 0.14 are supported for production
use in the following environments:

- Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit Server Edition
- Ubuntu 18.04 64-bit Server Edition
- CentOS 7 64-bit

For development purposes, most of our developers prefer to use Docker
containers. These and all above supported environments are linked from
the installation instructions above.

### Added {#added_7}

#### AIP Migration {#aip_migration}

This feature creates a new endpoint for the storage service API. It will
allow a client to make a request to the API to move an AIP from one
storage location to another storage location (of the same type). The
storage service is aware of the move so there is no need to re-index
(compared to moving AIPs manually).

The primary issue for this change is archivematica/Issues: [Issue
\#71](https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/71)

This work was sponsored by the Museum of Modern Art. Thank you!

#### Stored DIP deletion {#stored_dip_deletion}

This enhancement adds a new option to delete a DIP to the storage
service user interface.

This change is described by artefactual/archivematica-storage-service:
[Issue
\#319](https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica-storage-service/issues/319)

For documentation, see
[Packages](https://www.archivematica.org/en/docs/storage-service-0.14/administrators/#packages-tab)
in the Storage Service docs.

This work was sponsored by Simon Fraser University Archives. Thank you!

### Changed {#changed_8}

#### Increased internationalization {#increased_internationalization}

Archivematica 1.7 included user interface translation support (see [PR
506](https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica/pull/506)). This work
covered a majority of the user interface but did not include the text
describing jobs executed as part of the microservices. Those text
descriptions are held in the application database making it difficult to
maintain multiple translations.

This change moves these text descriptions out of the database and into
JSON files. This makes it much easier to add new translations and
maintain them over time.

Please note that while we transition to a new platform for translation
we are currently not accepting any newly translated strings for
Archivematica. For more info please see the [notification on the
Archivematica Google
Group](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/archivematica/6qMM1KJbWp8/LuPO_VqyEAAJ).

This enhancement is described by artefactual/archivematica [Issue
1101](https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica/issues/1101).

This work was sponsored in part by the Canadian Council of Archives.
Thank you!

#### Backend FPR changes {#backend_fpr_changes}

The Django app for the FPR was difficult to maintain so it has been
moved to the dashboard.

Issues: [Issue
\#181](https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/181) and [Issue
\#213](https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/213)

#### File identification changes {#file_identification_changes}

To address an issue with [file
identification](https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/485) we
have implemented a change in how file identification tools are chosen in
this release. Users now enable their chosen command (Fido, Siegfried or
file extension) in Preservation Planning, and the processing
configuration decision in the dashboard is now a simple Yes/No on
whether or not to identify the files. This brings file identification
more in line with other FPR rules and processing configuration
decisions.

Instructions on how to change the identification command in the FPR are
available in the
[Identification](https://www.archivematica.org/en/docs/archivematica-1.9/user-manual/preservation/preservation-planning/#identification)
section of the Preservation Planning documentation.

Please note - if you have the file identification decision point set in
your processing configuration, you need to reset it to \"Yes\" or \"No\"
as it will default to \"None\" after upgrade.

that these fixes are only relevant under one of two circumstances: if
you have upgraded from 1.7.x or earlier to 1.8, or if your installation
uses RPMs.

### Supported environments {#supported_environments_3}

There are no changes to supported environments in this release.

Please continue to follow the installation instructions
[here](https://www.archivematica.org/en/docs/archivematica-1.8/admin-manual/installation-setup/installation/installation/#installation).

### Fixed {#fixed_20}

- Transfers can\'t be started in AM18 RPM upgrades:
    <https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/360>

## Archivematica 1.8 and Storage Service 0.13

[Original release
notes](https://wiki.archivematica.org/Archivematica_1.8_and_Storage_Service_0.13_release_notes).

*Release date*: Nov 20th 2018

### Supported environments {#supported_environments_4}

Please see installation instructions [link
here](https://www.archivematica.org/en/docs/archivematica-1.8/admin-manual/installation-setup/installation/installation/#installation).

Archivematica 1.8 and Storage Service 0.13 are supported for production
use in the following environments:

- Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit Server Edition
- Ubuntu 18.04 64-bit Server Edition
- CentOS 7 64-bit

For development purposes, most of our developers prefer to use Docker
containers. These and all above supported environments are linked from
the installation instructions above.

### Added {#added_8}

#### Dataverse integration {#dataverse_integration}

Archivematica can now be configured to use a
[Dataverse](https://dataverse.org/) research data repository as a
transfer source location. Dataverse transfer source locations can be
configured to display all available datasets or a subset of them.
Datasets are retrieved directly using the Dataverse API and processed
using a new "Dataverse" transfer type. New Dataverse specific processing
includes:

- fixity checking using checksums generated by dataverse
- retrieval of derivative and metadata files associated with tabular
    data files
- creation of a Dataverse METS file describing the dataset as
    retrieved from Dataverse
- Dataverse metadata included in the AIP METS

Some advanced or more complex use cases are not fully supported, such as
handling of datasets with restricted files, versioning of datasets and
reingest of datasets. For a full list of known issues and enhancement
ideas, refer to the [Archivematica issues repository using Dataverse
label](https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/labels/OCUL%3A%20AM-Dataverse)
and the [Archivematica-Dataverse Integration Project
Wiki](https://wiki.archivematica.org/Dataverse).

Portal](https://scholarsportal.info/), a service of the Ontario Council
of University Libraries (OCUL). Thank you!

    for all issues with the Dataverse label.
- Documentation: [Dataverse
    Integration](https://www.archivematica.org/en/docs/archivematica-1.8/user-manual/transfer/dataverse/)

#### Public URL {#public_url}

Archivematica now has a concept of a public URL in the general
configuration. Archivematica usually registers itself with the Storage
Service, but if you have deployed Archivematica in an environment where
the URL or IP address changes frequently (i.e. in some Docker
environments) this can cause issues. In these types of environments,
users can now declare a stable public URL that Archivematica can use to
register with the Storage Service.

- Documentation: [General
    configuration](https://www.archivematica.org/docs/archivematica-1.8/admin-manual/installation-setup/customization/dashboard-config/#admin-dashboard-general)

#### Package storage in DSpace via its REST API {#package_storage_in_dspace_via_its_rest_api}

Since Archivematica 1.6 it\'s been possible to store AIPs in DSpace, but
they have been stored via SWORD. Some users have the need/desire to
store packages in DSpace via the REST API. This is now possible in
Storage Service 0.13.

This work was undertaken by Hrafn Malmquist at University of Edinburgh,
with assistance from developers at Artefactual Systems. Thank you!

    API](https://www.archivematica.org/en/docs/storage-service-0.13/administrators/#dspace-via-sword2-api-or-dspace-via-rest-api)

### Changed {#changed_9}

Enhancements or major fixes.

#### Automatic approval of transfers {#automatic_approval_of_transfers}

It is no longer necessary to approve transfers started in the user
interface. By default, a checkbox is ticked for the transfer to
automatically be approved- users may uncheck the box and approve their
transfers manually if desired.

This enhancement was sponsored by Jisc. Thank you!

- Issue:
    [1139](https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica/issues/1139)
- Documentation: [Process a
    transfer](https://www.archivematica.org/en/docs/archivematica-1.8/user-manual/transfer/transfer/#process-transfer)

#### Streamline checksum verification {#streamline_checksum_verification}

This enhancement de-duplicates checksum verification in Archivematica,
which helps to improve the performance of Archivematica in processing
large transfers (many files and/or large files). This enhancement
includes three changes:

- Remove the \"Verify checksums generated on ingest\" micro-service
- Enhance the \"Verify AIP\" micro-service to bulk query the database
    for transfer-generated checksums and then verify that they match
    what is documented in the bag-generated manifest-.txt.
- Have \"Verify AIP\" create an AIP-level \"fixity check\"
    PREMIS:EVENT that it can pass to the Storage Service, which will
    document this verification in the pointer file.

This should not impact regular workflows, but it is worth noting that
there is no AIP-level fixity check PREMIS event for uncompressed AIPs,
which don\'t have pointer files. For uncompressed AIPs, there are still
object-level fixity events in place. Note that there is an issue in the
Archivematica Issues repository regarding this note - [Problem:
uncompressed AIPs need pointer files
\#32](https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica-storage-service/issues/324)

This work was sponsored by Columbia University Library. Thank you!

- Issue:
    [918](https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica/issues/918)

#### Indexing can be enabled/disabled for Transfers and/or Archival Storage {#indexing_can_be_enableddisabled_for_transfers_andor_archival_storage}

Previously, the ElasticSearch index feature could be disabled globally
as a scalability measure since indexing consumes a lot of resources.
However, this also disabled Backlog and Appraisal features (which also
uses indexing) and which some users still wanted to access. As of
release 1.8, Archivematica can be deployed to run with indexing enabled
just for Transfers (Backlog and Appraisal enabled), just for Archival
Storage (Backlog and Appraisal disabled), for both indexes, or for none.

- Documentation: [Installation \>
    Elasticsearch](https://www.archivematica.org/docs/archivematica-1.8/admin-manual/installation-setup/installation/installation/#elasticsearch)

#### Configure email settings {#configure_email_settings}

This change improves the ways that the email client in Archivematica can
be configured, including allowing an administrator to set the sender
email address for emails sent by Archivematica (i.e. normalization
reports, failure reports) to comply with local IT requirements.

#### Download processing configuration and reset to default {#download_processing_configuration_and_reset_to_default}

Previous versions of Archivematica introduced the ability to add custom
processing configurations, but users had to retrieve the custom
configuration file via the command line to use it. There is now a
download button on Administration \> Processing configuration so that
you can download the processing config from the user interface.

You can also reset a processing configuration to the installation
pre-set by clicking on the new reset button on Administration \>
Processing configuration.

The documentation for using a custom processing configuration has also
been updated.

#### MCP batching for scalability & performance {#mcp_batching_for_scalability_performance}

This feature refactors how tasks are scheduled, executed & managed
within Archivematica, by grouping tasks into batches. It introduces
processing efficiencies that significantly decrease the processing power
and time required to complete Transfer and Ingest. It includes new
configuration options to further optimize processing efficiency for
particular types of Transfers (e.g. few large files vs. many small
files) and for different deployment patterns (e.g. installing components
across multiple machines).

#### Binder integration improvements {#binder_integration_improvements}

Archivematica has had an integration with
[Binder](https://binder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-manual/overview/intro.html)
for several years. Binder is an open-source web application for managing
time-based media and born-digital artworks. Binder depends on
integration with both Archivematica and TMS (The Museum System).

Since Binder is built off of [AtoM](https://www.accesstomemory.org/),
much of the integration configuration was repurposed from the AtoM
integration. Archivematica 1.8 makes it explicit, for example, that the
job \"DIP Upload to AtoM\" is actually \"DIP Upload to AtoM/Binder\". In
the Administration tab, the configuration section for AtoM has also been
renamed to include Binder.

Enhancing the Binder integration itself, Archivematica\'s transfer tab
now includes an \"Access system ID\" box. This allows users to
pre-populate an access system ID for AtoM or Binder, so that DIPs can be
automatically uploaded without having to stop at the Upload DIP
microservice. Users can still use the Upload DIP popup if desired.

Finally, we\'ve added documentation on using Binder with Archivematica.

#### Translations

First added in 1.7, translations in Archivematica are growing! In this
release, we\'ve pulled in translations for Archivematica.org, the
documentation, the FPR, the Storage Service, and the Archivematica
interface. The biggest part that is still missing is the
Archivematica\'s workflow engine - that is, all of the microservice and
job names in the interface. We are planning to include workflow
translations in 1.9.

Thanks to our wonderful community of translators on
[Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/artefactual/archivematica/dashboard/),
Archivematica resources can now be translated from English into French,
Spanish, Japanese, Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese, and Swedish. Note
that the completeness of each language for each resource depends on
volunteer contributions in Transifex.

This work was originally sponsored by the Canadian Council on Archives
through a DHCP (Documentary Heritage Community Programs) grant. Thank
you!

#### File format identification updates {#file_format_identification_updates}

Archivematica 1.8 is now up to date with PRONOM v.94! For more
information on new data added to PRONOM, check the [PRONOM release
notes](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/aboutapps/pronom/release-notes.xml).

This work was sponsored by the Denver Art Museum. Thank you!

#### Thumbnail normalization changes {#thumbnail_normalization_changes}

It is now easier to configure whether or not, and how, thumbnails are
created. In the processing configuration, users can choose between yes,
normalize for thumbnails, no, do not normalize for thumbnails, or yes,
do so but only if there is a default rule in place. For users who do not
need thumbnails this could make their processing faster.

### Added {#added_9}

#### Internationalization/localization

Translation hooks have been added to the Archivematica user interface,
the Storage Service, the documentation, and the Archivematica website.
This work will support the translation of those resources into many
languages through Artefactual\'s current localization platform,
[Transifex](https://www.transifex.com). Note that translation hooks for
Archivematica workflow components (microservice names, job names, and
drop-down options) will be added in Archivematica 1.8.

This work was sponsored by the [Canadian Council of
Archives](http://archivescanada.ca/AboutCCA). Thank you!

NOTE: this work prepares Archivematica for localization; however,
minimal translation has been completed. The interface will default to
English at the present time, but can be changed to another language in
the Settings menu.

#### AIP encryption {#aip_encryption}

This feature allows users to connect their Archivematica pipeline to
GPG-encrypted AIP Storage and Transfer Backlog spaces. AIPs and
transfers in backlog can also be encrypted. An AIP or transfer stored in
an encrypted location is encrypted at rest; when downloaded, an
encrypted AIP is decrypted for use.

#### Handle Server integration {#handle_server_integration}

Using this feature, Archivematica can be configured to make requests to
a Handle System HTTP API so that files, directories and entire AIPs can
be assigned persistent identifiers (PIDs) and derived persistent URLs
(PURLs) in the METS file. This work was sponsored by the [International
Institute of Social History](https://socialhistory.org/). Thank you!

#### Assign UUIDs to directories and empty directories {#assign_uuids_to_directories_and_empty_directories}

Related to Handle Server Integration, above, this feature gives users
the options of assigning UUIDs to directories and/or empty directories
within the AIP METS file. This adds two new microservices: Assign UUIDs
to directories and Document Empty directories. You may assign UUIDs to
directories and document empty directories even if you do not have a
handle server configured and are not binding PIDs. This work was
sponsored by the [International Institute of Social
History](https://socialhistory.org/). Thank you!

    directories](https://github.com/artefactual-labs/archivematica-acceptance-tests/blob/master/features/core/uuids-for-directories.feature)

#### Indexless Archivematica {#indexless_archivematica}

This feature supports deployment of Archivematica in indexless mode,
disabling ElasticSearch. This means that users that don\'t require
Archivematica\'s indexing features can save the compute resources
required for what can be an intensive task. Note that disabling the
Elasticsearch index means you cannot make use of the Backlog, Appraisal,
or Archival Storage tabs.

#### README file {#readme_file}

A README file in html format has been added to the AIP containing a
brief explanation of what the AIP is, how it was created and how it is
structured. See the contents of the README
[here](https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica/blob/f1e04ffe528156f83a137c6c4dbd228e6b53f5b2/src/MCPClient/lib/assets/README/README.html).

#### File modification dates {#file_modification_dates}

This feature adds a Store file modification job to the Characterize and
Extract metadata microservice and adds the metadata to the Elasticsearch
index. This allows users to view the last modified date of the files in
the Appraisal tab. This feature was sponsored by the [Bentley Historical
Library](http://bentley.umich.edu/) at University of Michigan. Thank
you!

### Changed {#changed_11}

#### Anti-virus changes {#anti_virus_changes}

**What has changed:**

Antivirus (AV) scanning using [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/) can now
be configured up to its maximum thresholds (previously Archivematica was
limited to ClamAV\'s default limits, around 25MB). It was discovered
that installing with the default limit would result in false-positive
PREMIS events indicating that files over 25 MB had been scanned. In
these instances, there is still a possibility that a malicious payload
existed, albeit a small chance because viruses are typically attached to
smaller files which are intended to be sent via email. Archivematica
will no longer record a PREMIS event where either a file cannot be
scanned due to the antivirus limits, or some other reason that might
suggest that AV scanning has not completed successfully. Please see the
[Archivematica 1.7
documentation](https://www.archivematica.org/en/docs/archivematica-1.7/user-manual/transfer/scan-for-viruses/)
on the effects of different configuration settings. Currently ClamAV has
an upward limit of 2 GB per file which in the Archivematica 1.7 release
is configured as the default.

**What does this mean?**

If you are concerned about AIPs created pre-Archivematica 1.7 containing
viruses, you can use AIP reingest to re-run antivirus. However, in the
majority of cases this will not be necessary. Factors to consider
include:

- what is the source of the material? Do you have reason to mistrust
    this source?
- what were the transfer protocols before the material was ingested by
    Archivematica? Did anitvirus scanning occur with another tool during
    that process?
- does your current storage system include periodic enterprise-wide
    virus scanning?

#### Archivematica decoupled from the FPR server {#archivematica_decoupled_from_the_fpr_server}

The FPR was originally created to manage preservation plans, i.e.
business rules and tool commands for format-based preservation events.
The FPR server's purpose has been to house the default rules and
commands while allowing institutions to make local alterations as
desired.

Going forward, we have made the decision to remove Archivematica's
dependency on the FPR server for the following reasons:

- The FPR rules on the FPR server are out of date. When new rules are
    added to the Preservation Planning tab in Archivematica, they
    aren\'t always being copied back to the FPR server.
- Currently, new Archivematica installations ping the FPR server,
    which records the IP address of the remote server. This data capture
    isn\'t useful and it isn't necessary.

Removing the FPR server as a dependency should not impact how
Archivematica is being used previous to 1.7.

The longer-term goal is to build a new FPR server, one that is
completely decoupled from Archivematica, which would serve up format
policy data to other applications using an open API. We would propose
that this future registry should not rely on a single vendor for
maintenance.

#### DIP upload and storage workflow improvements {#dip_upload_and_storage_workflow_improvements}

This work clarifies the sequence of the Upload DIP and Store DIP jobs on
the Ingest tab. The processing configuration settings have also been
updated so that almost every decision point can be automated (the
exception is Upload DIP, which requires data entry).

This work was sponsored by
[MoMA](https://www.moma.org/research-and-learning/archives/), the [MIT
Libraries](https://libraries.mit.edu/), and the [University of
York](https://www.york.ac.uk/library/). Thank you!

    [PR680](https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica/pull/680),
    [PR741](https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica/pull/741)

#### Dashboard API whitelist mechanism {#dashboard_api_whitelist_mechanism}

Two changes have been made to the API whitelist functionality:

- The default API whitelist setting is now empty.
- If the API whitelist setting is empty the user can still
    authenticate against the API using the key. The whitelist is only
    activated when at least one IP address is listed.

#### Default processing configuration {#default_processing_configuration}

As a result of several features in this release, the processing
configuration options have changed substantially, growing from 19
configurable decision points to 27. The new decision points include:

- Assign UUIDs to directories (related to Handle Server integration)
- Perform policy checks on originals (related to MediaConch
    integration)
- Perform policy checks on preservation derivatives (related to
    MediaConch integration)
- Perform policy checks on access derivatives (related to MediaConch
    integration)
- Bind PIDs (related to Handle Server integration)
- Document empty directories (related to Handle Server integration)
- Upload DIP (related to DIP upload and storage workflow improvements)
- Store DIP (related to DIP upload and storage workflow improvements)

We\'ve also changed the default configuration, leaving more decision
points set at \"None\", which will prompt the user to make a manual
decision as a transfer is being moved through the Archivematica
workflow. The purpose of these changes is to enable better testing - we
think it\'s important that users see as many decision points in real
time as possible while they are testing the system

We\'ve also set the compression level to 1 - fastest mode, which also
facilitates testing as it wraps up AIP and DIP storage more quickly;
however, it does mean that packages will not be as compressed as they
could be. If you have limited space on your test machine, we recommend
either deleting packages on a regular basis or changing the compression
level to a higher number so that packages are smaller.

Note that changes to the default configuration **should not** override
your local configuration during an upgrade or migration.

#### Miscellaneous changes {#miscellaneous_changes}

- Storage Service timeouts increased from 5 seconds to 120 seconds

### End of life dependencies {#end_of_life_dependencies_2}

Several dependencies in Archivematica have reached end of life and
resources did not allow for updates in 1.7. In future releases we will
address these dependencies:

- Django 1.8
- Elasticsearch 1.7
- Percona 5.5

To mitigate risks related with using these dependencies you might
consider:

- Installing Archivematica behind a firewall
- Using Archivematica without Elasticsearch (turn indexing off)

## Archivematica 1.6 release notes

[Original release
notes](https://wiki.archivematica.org/Archivematica_1.6_release_notes).

We are dedicating the Archivematica 1.6 release to the memory of Nancy
Deromedi. Many of our users will know that a major defining feature of
this release is the new Appraisal and Arrangement tab. This idea was
conceived and sponsored by the Bentley Historical Library at the
University of Michigan, under the leadership of Nancy Deromedi. Sadly,
her life was cut short by cancer before the project was completed. From
Michael Shallcross, Bentley Historical Library:

"Nancy Deromedi was a leader in the field of digital preservation at the
University of Michigan\'s Bentley Historical Library from 1997 until her
untimely passing in 2014. Always eager to explore new ideas and
strategies, she inspired her colleagues to innovate, take risks, and
embrace emerging technologies. The success of the Bentley\'s
\"ArchivesSpace-Archivematica-DSpace Workflow Integration\" project
(funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation) is very much a tribute to
her vision, generosity of spirit, and constant drive to find better and
more efficient solutions to preserve and provide access to digital
archives."
