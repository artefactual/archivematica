# Code review

Every new feature and bugfix to a project is expected to go through code review
before inclusion. This applies both to developers at Artefactual and to outside
contributors.

The contribution process in general is outlined in the
[contributing document](CONTRIBUTING.md). This provides a checklist and set of
guidelines for what to do when doing code review. It also helps set
expectations for contributors about what to expect.

## Checklist

### Meta

- [ ] Have they submitted a signed contributor's agreement?
- [ ] Does this meet the requirements? Does it fix the bug?
- [ ] Is this feature useful to multiple users or potential users?
- [ ] Have the changes been discussed with an analyst?
- [ ] Is this one logical piece of work? Does it make sense to be split into
  multiple PRs for each sub-feature?
- [ ] Is there documentation?  This includes docstrings, comments & potentially
  user-facing documentation.
- [ ] Is the commit history clean?

### Architecture

- [ ] Does this duplicate functionality found elsewhere?
- [ ] Does it make more sense for this to be implemented elsewhere? E.g. Should
  this happen in the storage service vs. a client script, or should a helper
  function live in archivematicaCommon?
- [ ] Does this add or reduce technical debt?
- [ ] Does this conflict with or benefit from work being done in parallel?
- [ ] Does this have security implications? Does it add or close a security
  vulnerability?
- [ ] Is there a more efficient way to do this? Is the more efficient way
  significantly less readable?
- [ ] Is this change backwards compatible? If not, could it be?  Should the API
  be versioned?
- [ ] Does this work for upgrades?  Does this require additional processing for
  existing items?

### Style

- [ ] Does it follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
  (code style) and [PEP257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/)
  (docstrings)?
- [ ] Do docstrings list the parameters and behaviour?
- [ ] Are the names accurate and sensible?
- [ ] Are there massive functions, classes or files? Can they be split?
- [ ] Are errors handled?  Is the error handling consistent with similar code?

### Syntax

- [ ] Is it Python 2.7 & Python 3 compatible?
- [ ] Are all user-facing strings marked for translation?
- [ ] Do database changes have migrations?

### Tests

- [ ] Are there tests?
- [ ] Do the tests cover all the new functionality or fixes?
- [ ] Do the tests handle error cases?
- [ ] Is unit testing or integration testing more appropriate?
- [ ] Does this work with non-ASCII?

### Doing

- [ ] Do I understand what this is supposed to do?
- [ ] Have I checked out and run this code to verify it does what it says & is
  supposed to?
- [ ] Is someone else an expert in this area? Should I ask them to also review
  this?
