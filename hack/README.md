## Audience

This Archivematica environment is based on Docker Compose and it is
specifically **designed for developers**. Compose can be used in a production
environment but that is beyond the scope of this recipe. Please read
the [documentation][audience-compose-reference].

Artefactual developers use Docker Compose on Linux heavily so it's important
that you're familiar with it, and some choices in the configuration of this
environment break in other operative systems.

[audience-compose-reference]: https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/overview/

## Requirements

[System requirements][requirements-am-docs]. The following is a sample of
memory usage when the environment is initialized in a virtual machine with
8 GB of RAM:

```shell
docker stats --all --format "table {{.Name}}\t{{.MemUsage}}"
```
```console
NAME                                 MEM USAGE / LIMIT
am-archivematica-mcp-client-1        41.3MiB / 7.763GiB
am-archivematica-dashboard-1         145.1MiB / 7.763GiB
am-archivematica-mcp-server-1        39.43MiB / 7.763GiB
am-archivematica-storage-service-1   83.96MiB / 7.763GiB
am-nginx-1                           2.715MiB / 7.763GiB
am-elasticsearch-1                   900.2MiB / 7.763GiB
am-fits-1                            71.09MiB / 7.763GiB
am-gearmand-1                        3.395MiB / 7.763GiB
am-mysql-1                           551.9MiB / 7.763GiB
am-clamavd-1                         570MiB / 7.763GiB
```

Software dependencies: Docker Engine, Docker Compose, git and make. Please use
a version of Docker Engine greater than 23.0 which includes Buildkit as the
default builder with support for multi-stage builds and a version of Docker
Compose greater than 2.17 which supports restarts of dependent services.

It is beyond the scope of this document to explain how these dependencies are
installed in your computer.

Follow [these instructions][requirements-docker-install] to install Docker
Engine in Ubuntu. Docker also provides instructions on how to use it as a
[non-root user][requirements-docker-non-root] so you don't have to run the
following `docker compose` commands with `sudo`. Make sure to read about the
[security implications][requirements-docker-security] of this change.

[requirements-docker-security]: https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface

### Elasticsearch container

For the Elasticsearch container to run properly, you may need to increase the
maximum virtual memory address space `vm.max_map_count` to at least `262144`.
This is a configuration setting on the host machine running Docker, not the
container itself.

To make this change run:

```shell
sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
```

To persist this setting, modify `/etc/sysctl.conf` and add:

```text
vm.max_map_count=262144
```

For more information, please consult the Elasticsearch `6.x`
[documentation][elasticsearch-docs-map-count].

[elasticsearch-docs-map-count]: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/vm-max-map-count.html

## Installation

First, clone this repository this way:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica.git --branch qa/1.x --recurse-submodules
```

This will set up the submodules defined in 
https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica/tree/qa/1.x/hack/submodules which
are from the `qa/1.x` branch of Archivematica and the `qa/0.x` branch of
Archivematica Storage Service. These two branches are the focus of
Archivematica development and pull requests are expected to target them.

Next, run the installation (and all Docker Compose) commands from within the
`hack` directory:

```shell
cd ./archivematica/hack
```

Run the following command to create two Docker external volumes:

```shell
make create-volumes
```

These are heavily used in our containers but they are provided in the host
machine:

- `$HOME/.am/am-pipeline-data` - Archivematica's shared directory.
- `$HOME/.am/ss-location-data` - the transfer source location.

Next, build the Docker images:

```shell
make build
```

You may want to rebuild images with this command after updating the
`Dockerfile` or the Python requirement files, but it's not necessary to rebuild
the images after changing Python code.

Start the services with:

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

On the first run, the Archivematica services will fail because the databases
of the Dashboard and the Storage Service have not been created. To do so, run:

```shell
make bootstrap
```

Be aware that this command drops and recreates both databases, and then runs
Django's migrations so you will lose any existing data if you run it again.

Now that the databases have been created, use the following command to restart
only the Archivematica services:

```shell
make restart-am-services
```

You should now be able to access Archivematica services through the [Web UIs](#web-uis).

### GNU make

Make commands above, and any subsequent calls to it below can be reviewed using
the following command:

```shell
make help
```

## Upgrading to the latest version of Archivematica

To upgrade your installation to include the most recent changes in the
submodules, use the following commands:

```shell
git pull --rebase
git submodule update --init --recursive
docker compose up -d --force-recreate --build
make bootstrap
make restart-am-services
```

The submodules are not always up to date, i.e. they may not be pointing to the
latest commits of their tracking branches. They can be updated manually using
`git pull --rebase`:

```shell
cd ./submodules/archivematica-storage-service && git pull --rebase
cd ./submodules/archivematica-sampledata && git pull --rebase
cd ./submodules/archivematica-acceptance-tests && git pull --rebase
```

Once you're done, run:

```shell
docker compose up -d --force-recreate --build
make bootstrap
make restart-am-services
```

Working with submodules can be a little confusing. GitHub's
[Working with submodules][submodules-0] blog post is a good introduction.

[submodules-0]: https://blog.github.com/2016-02-01-working-with-submodules/

## Web UIs

- Archivematica Dashboard: http://127.0.0.1:62080/
- Archivematica Storage Service: http://127.0.0.1:62081/

The default credentials for the Archivematica Dashboard and the Storage Service
are username: `test`, password: `test`.

## Source code auto-reloading

Dashboard and Storage Service are both served by Gunicorn. We set up Gunicorn
with the [reload](http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/settings.html#reload)
setting enabled meaning that the Gunicorn workers will be restarted as soon as
code changes.

Other components in the stack like the `MCPServer` don't offer this option and
they need to be restarted manually, e.g.:

    docker compose up -d --force-recreate --no-deps archivematica-mcp-server

If you've added new dependencies or changes the `Dockerfile` you should also
add the `--build` argument to the previous command in order to ensure that the
container is using the newest image, e.g.:

    docker compose up -d --force-recreate --build --no-deps archivematica-mcp-server

## Logs

In recent versions of Archivematica we've changed the logging configuration so
the log events are sent to the standard streams. This is a common practice
because it makes much easier to aggregate the logs generated by all the
replicas that we may be deploying of our services across the cluster.

Docker Compose aggregates the logs for us so you can see everything from one
place. Some examples:

- `docker compose logs --follow`
- `docker compose logs --follow archivematica-storage-service`
- `docker compose logs --follow nginx archivematica-dashboard`

### Clearing the logs

Docker keeps the logs in files using the [JSON File logging driver][logs-0].
If you want to clear them, we provide a simple script that can do it for us
quickly but it needs root privileges, e.g.:

```shell
sudo make flush-logs
```

[logs-0]: https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/json-file/

## Scaling

With Docker Compose we can run as many containers as we want for a service,
e.g. by default we only provision a single replica of the
`archivematica-mcp-client` service but nothing stops you from running more:

```shell
docker compose up -d --scale archivematica-mcp-client=3
```

We still have one service but three containers. Let's verify that the workers
are connected to Gearman:

```shell
echo workers | socat - tcp:127.0.0.1:62004,shut-none | grep "_v0.0" | awk '{print $2}' - | sort -u
```
```console
172.19.0.15
172.19.0.16
172.19.0.17
```

## Ports

| Service                                 | Container port | Host port   |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| mysql                                   | `tcp/3306`     | `tcp/62001` |
| elasticsearch                           | `tcp/9200`     | `tcp/62002` |
| gearman                                 | `tcp/4730`     | `tcp/62004` |
| fits                                    | `tcp/2113`     | `tcp/62005` |
| clamavd                                 | `tcp/3310`     | `tcp/62006` |
| nginx » archivematica-dashboard         | `tcp/80`       | `tcp/62080` |
| nginx » archivematica-storage-service   | `tcp/8000`     | `tcp/62081` |

## Tests

The `Makefile` includes many useful targets for testing. List them all with:

```shell
make help | grep test-
```

The following targets use [`tox`](https://tox.readthedocs.io) and
[`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org) to run the tests using MySQL:

```
test-all                   Run all tests.
test-archivematica-common  Run Archivematica Common tests.
test-dashboard             Run Dashboard tests.
test-mcp-client            Run MCPClient tests.
test-mcp-server            Run MCPServer tests.
test-storage-service       Run Storage Service tests.
```

`tox` sets up separate virtual environments for each target and calls
`pytest` to run the tests. Their configurations live in the `tox.ini`
and `pytest.ini` files but you can set the [`TOXARGS`][tox-cli] and
[`PYTEST_ADDOPTS`][pytest-cli] environment variables to pass command
line options to each.

[tox-cli]: https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#cli
[pytest-cli]: https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/example/simple.html#how-to-change-command-line-options-defaults

For example you can run all the tests in `tox` [parallel
mode](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example/basic.html#parallel-mode)
and make it extra verbose like this:

```shell
env TOXARGS='-vv --parallel' make test-all
```

The MySQL databases created by `pytest` are kept and reused after
each run, but you could [force it to recreate them][pytest-recreate-db] like
this:

```shell
env PYTEST_ADDOPTS='--create-db' make test-dashboard
```

[pytest-recreate-db]: https://pytest-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/database.html#example-work-flow-with-reuse-db-and-create-db

Or you could run only a specific test module using its relative path
in the `PYTHONPATH` of the `tox` environment like this:

```shell
env PYTEST_ADDOPTS=tests/test_reingest_mets.py make test-mcp-client
```

### AMAUATs

The sources of the [Archivematica Automated User Acceptance Tests
(AMAUATs)](https://github.com/artefactual-labs/archivematica-acceptance-tests)
are available inside Docker using volumes so you can edit
them and the changes will apply immediately. They can be executed with the
`test-at-behave` Makefile target.

For example, once your Archivematica services start and you can reach the [Web
UIs](#web-uis) you can execute the [`black-box`][amauats-black-box] tag of the
AMAUATs in Firefox like this:

```shell
make test-at-behave TAGS=black-box BROWSER=Firefox
```

[amauats-black-box]: https://github.com/artefactual-labs/archivematica-acceptance-tests/tree/qa/1.x/features/black_box

## Resetting the environment

In many cases, as a tester or a developer, you want to restart all the
containers at once and make sure the latest version of the images are built.
But also, you don't want to lose your data like the search index or the
database. If this is case, run the following command:

```shell
docker compose up -d --force-recreate --build
```

Additionally you may want to delete all the data including the stuff in the
external volumes:

```shell
make flush
```

Both snippets can be combined or used separately.

You may need to update the codebase, and for that you can run this command:

```shell
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Cleaning up

The most effective way is:

```shell
docker compose down --volumes
```

It doesn't delete the external volumes described in the
[Installation](#installation) section of this document. You have to delete the
volumes manually with:

```shell
docker volume rm am-pipeline-data
docker volume rm ss-location-data
```

Optionally you may also want to delete the directories:

```shell
rm -rf $HOME/.am/am-pipeline-data $HOME/.am/ss-location-data
```

## Percona tuning

To use different settings on the MySQL container, please edit the
`etc/mysql/tunning.conf` file and rebuild the container with:

```shell
docker compose up -d --force-recreate mysql
```

## Instrumentation

### Running Prometheus and Grafana

[Prometheus][instrumentation-0] and [Grafana][instrumentation-1] can be used
to monitor Archivematica processes.

To run them, reference the `docker-compose.instrumentation.yml` file:

```shell
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.instrumentation.yml up -d
```

Prometheus will start on [127.0.0.1:9090][instrumentation-2]; Grafana on
[127.0.0.1:3000][instrumentation-3].

[instrumentation-0]: https://prometheus.io/
[instrumentation-1]: https://grafana.com/
[instrumentation-2]: http://127.0.0.1:9090
[instrumentation-3]: http://127.0.0.1:3000

### Percona Monitoring and Management

Extending the default environment, you can deploy an instance of
[Percona Monitoring and Management][instrumentation-4] configured by default to
collect metrics and query analytics data from the `mysql` service. To set up the
PMM server and client services alongside all the others you'll need to indicate
two Docker Compose files:

```shell
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.pmm.yml up -d
```

To access the PMM server interface, visit http://127.0.0.1:62007:

* Username: ``admin``
* Password: ``admin``

[instrumentation-4]: https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management

## Troubleshooting

### Nginx returns 502 Bad Gateway

We're using Nginx as a proxy. Likely the underlying issue is that
either the Dashboard or the Storage Service died. Run `docker compose
ps` to confirm the state of their services like this:

```shell
docker compose ps --all archivematica-dashboard archivematica-storage-service
```
```console
NAME                                 IMAGE                              COMMAND                  SERVICE                         CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS
am-archivematica-dashboard-1         am-archivematica-dashboard         "/usr/local/bin/guni…"   archivematica-dashboard         11 minutes ago      Up 27 seconds               8000/tcp
am-archivematica-storage-service-1   am-archivematica-storage-service   "/usr/local/bin/guni…"   archivematica-storage-service   11 minutes ago      Exited (3) 28 seconds ago
```

You want to see what's in the logs of the `archivematica-storage-service`
service, e.g.:

```shell
docker compose logs --no-log-prefix --tail 5 archivematica-storage-service
```
```console
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 953, in _find_and_load_unlocked
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'storage_service.wsgi'
[2023-06-02 03:53:00 +0000] [9] [INFO] Worker exiting (pid: 9)
[2023-06-02 03:53:00 +0000] [1] [INFO] Shutting down: Master
[2023-06-02 03:53:00 +0000] [1] [INFO] Reason: Worker failed to boot.
```

Now we know why -  I had deleted the `wsgi` module. The worker crashed and
Gunicorn gave up. This could happen for example when we're rebasing a branch
and git is not atomically moving things around. But it's fixed now and you want
to give it another shot so we run `docker compose up -d` to ensure that all the
services are up again. Next run `docker compose ps` to verify that it's all up.

### Bootstrap seems to run but the Dashboard and Elasticsearch are still down

If after running the bootstrap processes and `docker compose ps` still shows
that the dashboard and elasticsearch are still down then check the
elasticsearch logs using:

```shell
docker compose logs --no-log-prefix --tail 8 elasticsearch
```

You may see entries as follows:

```console
[2023-06-02T03:50:27,970][INFO ][o.e.b.BootstrapChecks    ] [am-node] bound or publishing to a non-loopback address, enforcing bootstrap checks
ERROR: [1] bootstrap checks failed
[1]: max virtual memory areas vm.max_map_count [65530] is too low, increase to at least [262144]
[2023-06-02T03:50:28,006][INFO ][o.e.n.Node               ] [am-node] stopping ...
[2023-06-02T03:50:28,077][INFO ][o.e.n.Node               ] [am-node] stopped
[2023-06-02T03:50:28,077][INFO ][o.e.n.Node               ] [am-node] closing ...
[2023-06-02T03:50:28,088][INFO ][o.e.n.Node               ] [am-node] closed
[2023-06-02T03:50:28,090][INFO ][o.e.x.m.j.p.NativeController] [am-node] Native controller process has stopped - no new native processes can be started
```

This indicates that you may need to increase the virtual memory available to
Elasticsearch, as discussed in the section [Elasticsearch container][es-0]
above.

[es-0]: #elasticsearch-container

### PMM client service doesn't start

In some cases the `pmm_client` service fails to start reporting the following
error:

```console
[main] app already is running, exiting
```

You'll need to fully recreate the container to make it work:

```shell
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.pmm.yml rm pmm_client
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.pmm.yml up -d
```

### My environment is still broken

You've read this far but you haven't yet figured out why your development
environment is not working? Here are some tips:

- Does your system meet the [requirements](#requirements)? Some services like
  Elasticsearch or ClamAV need a lot of memory!
- Make sure that you've checked out the
  [latest](https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica/commits/qa/1.x)
  commit of this repository.
- Make sure that your repositories under `/hack/submodules`
  (submodules) are up to date. If you are working off your own
  branches, make sure they are not outdated.  Rebase often!
- Look for open/closed [issues][am-issues] that may relate to your
  problem!
- [Get support](https://www.archivematica.org/community/support/).
