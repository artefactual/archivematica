#
# --- This is the MCP (master control program) ---
# The intention of this program is to provide a centralized automated distributed system for performing an arbitrary set of tasks on a directory.
# Distributed in that the work can be performed on more than one physical computer simultaneously.
# Centralized in that there is one centre point for configuring flow through the system.
# Automated in that the tasks performed will be based on the config files and instantiated for each of the targets.
#
# It loads configurations from the database.
