        Creates a new ReplacementDict option with the standard variables
        populated based on values taken from the models passed in.
        SIP and File instances can be passed as arguments, using the sip
        and file_ keyword arguments respectively. sip accepts both SIP
        and Transfer objects.

        By default, path strings returned via this constructor are not
        absolute, but include the %sharedPath% variable in place of the
        actual path to the Archivematica shared path. This matches the
        behaviour previously used by the ReplacementDict construction code
        in the Unit classes, and is suitable for passing paths to the
        MCPClient. If the expand_path keyword argument is set to True,
        then true absolute paths will be returned instead. This is useful
        when creating ReplacementDicts within MCPClient scripts.

        If both sip and file_ are passed in, values from both will be
        included. Since there is some overlap in variable naming, the
        type_ keyword argument must be used to indicate the context
        in which the dict is being created. Supported values are 'file',
        'sip', and 'transfer'. The default is 'file'.
