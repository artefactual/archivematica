"""Worker pool.

WorkerPool is the core of MCPClient, a pool of system processes that are
independent Gearman workers. Only one process in the pool will handle tasks
unless marked as safe for concurrent instances.

The pool ensures that processes are replaced when they fail or exit. The max.
number or processes allowed in the pool can be established with the ``workers``
setting. Workers can also be programmed to perform a limited number of tasks
with ``max_tasks_per_child``, which is useful to free resources held.

Workers log events into a shared queue while the pool runs a background thread
(log listener) that listens to the queue and writes the events safely.
